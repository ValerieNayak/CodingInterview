## Technical Questions
Tips from Cracking the Coding Interview (and other resources I find) <br>
Preparation: <br>
1. Try to solve the problem on your own first.
2. Write the code on paper.
3. Test the code on paper.
4. Type code as-is into the computer.
<br> All the data structures, algorithms, and concepts on p. 61 of CTCI are important to know how to use and implement. **Hash tables** in particular are very important to be comfortable with.

## Directory
A directory of all the files in this repo. 

### Big O
[BigO.py](BigO.py): Code that goes with the BigO section of Cracking the Coding Interview <br>
[BigO.md](BigO.md): Some notes to go along with the python file. Notes also taken from a HackerRank YouTube video.

### Recursion and Memoization
[recursion_memoization.py](recursion_memoization.py): Notes and code on recursion with memoization. The idea of memoization is to cache the values of previous recursive calls so that your code doesn't redo the same work over and over. I learned it from [this Socratica video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk0zUZW-U_M), which demonstrates it with the recursive fibonacci code. This code shows both how to implement memoization yourself and how to do it in a single line by using a python library.
